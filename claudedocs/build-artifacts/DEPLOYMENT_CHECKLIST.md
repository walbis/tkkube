- [ ] All unit tests passing (100%)
- [ ] All integration tests passing (100%)
- [ ] Performance within acceptable bounds
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities detected
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] Operational runbooks validated

- [x] Core functionality compiled successfully
- [x] Basic unit tests passing (80%+)
- [x] Configuration system functional
- [x] Authentication system working
- [x] Storage connectivity established
- [ ] Integration testing in progress

### üî¥ Red - Not Ready
- [ ] Compilation failures present
- [ ] Critical security issues found
- [ ] Major functionality not working
- [ ] Dependencies not resolved
- [ ] Configuration invalid
- [ ] Storage backend not accessible

**Current Status**: üü° **YELLOW - READY FOR CRC TESTING**

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ High Risk Items
- **Long-running tests**: Some tests timeout after 30+ seconds, may need optimization for CI/CD
- **Mock dependencies**: Test mocks may need updates for specific CRC environment
- **Resource constraints**: CRC memory/CPU limits may affect backup performance with large datasets

### üü° Medium Risk Items
- **Test coverage gaps**: Some integration paths not fully tested due to environment dependencies
- **Configuration complexity**: Many configuration options may lead to misconfigurations
- **Network dependencies**: Backup system relies on stable networking between components

### üü¢ Low Risk Items
- **Core compilation**: All source code compiles successfully without errors
- **Basic functionality**: Authentication, validation, and orchestration logic is sound
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with circuit breaker patterns
- **Documentation**: Extensive documentation and usage examples available

## CRC-Specific Considerations

### ‚úÖ CRC Strengths
- **Single-node simplicity**: Easier to debug and trace issues
- **Full OpenShift compatibility**: All OpenShift features available
- **Local development**: Fast iteration and testing cycles
- **Resource isolation**: Controlled environment for testing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRC Limitations
- **Single cluster only**: Cannot test true multi-cluster scenarios
- **Resource constraints**: Limited CPU/memory may affect performance testing
- **Network isolation**: Cannot test cross-datacenter networking scenarios
- **Persistence limitations**: EmptyDir volumes don't survive restarts

### üîß CRC Adaptations Required
- **Configuration tuning**: Timeout values adjusted for single-node performance
- **Resource discovery**: Limited to CRC cluster resources only
- **Storage backend**: MinIO deployed within same cluster (not external)
- **Authentication**: Using CRC-generated tokens instead of production certificates

## Deployment Success Criteria

### Must Have ‚úÖ
1. **Compilation Success**: All components build without errors
2. **Basic Connectivity**: Can connect to CRC cluster and authenticate
3. **Storage Access**: Can read/write to MinIO storage backend
4. **Resource Discovery**: Can enumerate cluster resources for backup
5. **Configuration Loading**: Can parse and validate backup configurations

### Should Have ‚è≥
1. **Full Backup Cycle**: Complete backup and validation of test workloads
2. **Performance Baseline**: Backup completes within reasonable timeframes
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of common failure scenarios
4. **Monitoring**: Basic metrics and logging operational
5. **API Functionality**: HTTP endpoints responding correctly

### Nice to Have ‚è≥
1. **Performance Optimization**: Concurrent operations improving speed
2. **Advanced Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics integration
3. **Automated Recovery**: Circuit breaker and retry logic working
4. **Documentation Validation**: All guides work in CRC environment
5. **Load Testing**: System handles multiple namespaces efficiently
